# Python Exercises Repository

Welcome to my **Python Exercises Repository**! ðŸš€ This repository contains a collection of Python scripts, categorized by different exercise levels and topics. These scripts cover a wide range of programming concepts, from basic syntax to cryptographic algorithms and networking.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The exercises are structured into different levels and topics:

- **ex_1_** - Beginner-level exercises (e.g., Hello World, basic calculations, string manipulations)
- **ex_2_** - Intermediate exercises (e.g., password validation, factorial calculation, Rock-Paper-Scissors game)
- **ex_3_** - Advanced exercises (e.g., Collatz sequence, repeated squaring, highest/lowest letter identification)
- **ex_4_** - Cryptography-related exercises (e.g., IBAN check, frequency analysis, replacement cipher, DH key exchange)
- **ex_5_** - Encryption and security-based exercises (e.g., RSA, ElGamal, VigenÃ¨re cipher)
- **ex_6_** - Hashing and regex exercises (e.g., password hashing, email extraction, mathematical expression search)
- **ex_7_** - HTTP requests and web security exercises (e.g., login logs, HTTP requests, user-agent spoofing)
- **ex_N_** - Networking and cybersecurity-related exercises (e.g., ARP spoofing detection, TCP checksum calculation, DNS security)
- **ex_W_** - Web security exercises (e.g., Content Security Policy, same-origin policy enforcement)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Clone the Repository
