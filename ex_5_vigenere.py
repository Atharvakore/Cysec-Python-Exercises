# TODO implement
# Recall the Vigenere cipher from the lecture. Write a function vigenere_encrypt(message: str, key: str) -> str that given a key and a message message in lowercase encrypts it using the Vigenere cipher.
# For this you have to use cycle function from itertools and the builtin zip function. Please import cycle as from itertools import cycle. You are free to import strings.
